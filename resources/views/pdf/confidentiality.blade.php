Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, disparage or otherwise interfere with the Business for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A. &nbsp; <i>"Confidential Information" </i> means all information disclosed or made available to You regarding Seller and the Business, including this listing terms, all financial information, asset and equipment lists, customer and vendor lists, and employee information.  Confidential Information does not include Seller information to the extent that such information:  (i) was, at the time of disclosure or thereafter becomes, generally available to the public other than by breach of this provision; (ii) was in Your possession prior to disclosure by Seller or Seller�s representatives; (iii) is acquired in good faith from a third party who obtained it lawfully and not under an obligation of secrecy; or (iv) was or is developed independently within Your organization by personnel not having access to such information.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; B. &nbsp; <i>"Trade Secrets"</i>Under the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act means information including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, product, system, or process, design, prototype, procedure, or code that:<br>
  A.	Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by the public or any other person who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and<br>
  B. is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy<br>
  C.  A trade secret may consist of a simple fact, item, or procedure, or a series or sequence of items or procedures which, although individually could be perceived as relatively minor or simple, collectively can make a substantial difference in the efficiency of a process or the production of a product, or may be the basis of a marketing or commercial strategy. The collective effect of the items and procedures must be considered in any analysis of whether a trade secret exists and not the general knowledge of each individual item or procedure.<br><br>
 D. <i>"You" </i> means the person or persons executing this Agreement and includes any entity controlled or under common control by You, whether or not now in existence.<br><br>
 E. <i>"Seller" </i> means the owner or owners of the Business.<br><br>

<b>11. &nbsp;  Term of Representation. </b> Broker shall represent Me for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement with regard to the Business.  If Broker's representation of Me terminates during this period, and I purchase all or part of the Business, or if I make a loan to or invest in the Business any way, then Broker shall be due a commission equal to 12% of the consideration paid, loaned or invested in the Business but in no case less than a minimum amount of $12,000 (the "Commission").
